# TranslateMe

## Description
TranslateMe is an app that enables users to translate words, phrases, or sentences between languages using MyMemoryâ€™s REST API. It saves translations in Firebase, allowing users to access a history of past translations, which can be viewed or erased. This project combines SwiftUI design, networking, and data persistence to build a functional and creative translation tool.
